# Implementation Plan: SCAFFOLD-frontend-app

## Technical Context
- Platform: frontend.
- Set up the project skeleton for this stack: dependency manifest, entrypoint, and linting/formatting config.
- Add environment-based configuration loading (no hardcoded secrets or endpoints).
- Add a basic page/route shell so the app can run locally and render something.

## Contract Changes
- No material API, event, or data contract change is evidenced.

## Security and Quality
- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or endpoints -- all configuration must be loaded from environment variables.
- The scaffolded app must start successfully and render its initial page/route shell using only environment-based configuration.

## Verification Plan
- **AC-1**: Scaffold the User Management Web App (service) per its approved architecture. Ground the generated spec in this service's own component/MFE decomposition and UX artifacts already on file, not just this summary.
